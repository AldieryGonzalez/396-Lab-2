## Describe each of the four GIFs

The first one was made to try and mimic the look of the ocean from a top down perspective.
The second was just a vision of a ball bouncing and warping back to the other side, but in a more seamless way.
The third is a peaceful pinwheel that spins, and totally not a flower.
The last one was supposed to be a wheel that spirals as it draws itself, but I couldnt quite get anything done about making the
entire canvas spin along with the drawing

## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting to you about it?

The most interesting method by far, though the one that i had the least grasp in was the push/pop/rotate method, mainly because
of the implications of being able to make complex shapes and perhaps rotate them for animation or not have to translate complex math,
but do things in a way where the work is done, now we just need smal iterations on it.

## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?

I found the idea of vectors that would help with movement of things over time, but I could not find out how to get it to work
for my intended purposes.

## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about that techinque?

I feel like I took the easy way out on making a gif that just rotates in a consistent manner. I just got really lucky recording it in a
way that it loops infinitely.

## Link a few GIFs you found inspirational here

The ocean noise is something that I wanted to replicate from an old project, that i got using base canvas work, but I couldn't find
even the original material that i used back then, so this is kind of just winging it from the template you gave

I was also inspired by a [hypnotic spiral](https://i.gifer.com/origin/c0/c0dbd03919fd9e2536c05788255ffd08_w200.gif)
